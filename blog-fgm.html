<h1 class="col-12 float-left p-0">Forever Greenmont Website</h1>
<p class="col-12 float-left p-0">10/31/20</p>

<div class="paragraph-container col-12 col-xl-7 float-left p-0">
  <h4 class="col-12 float-left p-0">Brief</h4>
<p class="col-12 float-left p-0">
  Forever Greenmont is a website designed for the purpose of accomplishing two goals: showcasing renovated properties in the Greenmont district of Morgantown, and also sharing the perks, points of interest, and local businesses that make up their community. Upon first getting the brief, this sounded like a case of not being able to settle on a specific goal, and as a result sticking them together. It took some serious planning, and an intricate information architecture to seamlessly work these two missions into one cohesive website.
</p>

  <h4 class="col-12 float-left p-0">Process</h4>
<p class="col-12 float-left p-0">
  This was my first independent web project since the Covid-19 pandemic started, so having meetings over the phone and communicating almost primarily via Slack was a big adjustment as I typically like to have meeting and speak face-to-face. For this reason, the project seemed to be ever-expanding, accumulating new features and functions we had not anticipated from the start.
</p>

<p class="col-12 float-left p-0">
  Setting the pandemic aside, there were many technical hurdles involved in building this website. It had to house a ton of content, renovations, rentals, perks, a history page, and a photo gallery, among other items. Each one containing very different stories. This website also had to be editable by the client, who despises computers and technology.
</p>

<p class="col-12 float-left p-0">
  With these challenges in mind, I started in Illustrator to design style tiles for the client to present to the client. From there I created mockups and prototypes in XD that she could start user testing how the site would work. After a week or two in this stage I jumped into the code. This was where most of the time was spent.
</p>

<p class="col-12 float-left p-0">
  The website started out with basic HTML, CSS, a little bit of JavaScript, and I utilized the Bootstrap framework for my grid. After templating out each unique page, it was time to transplant the website into Wordpress using a custom theme. Adapting your website for Wordpress at the most basic level is not overly difficult, but adding custom fields is where all the real work comes in. In order to make this website achieve the goals of my client, I had to add custom fields and post types, which allowed her to easily add and remove her own content, as well as modify it to to suit outlying cases where content might need different treatments.
</p>

<h4 class="col-12 float-left p-0">Final Product</h4>
<p class="col-12 float-left p-0">
  The end product is a content-rich website that houses massive photo libraries, and tells a great story. My client has a love of history and this website enables her to document and tell the stories of each of her properties, as well as the local attractions that surround them.
